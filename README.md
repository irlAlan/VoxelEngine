# VoxelEngine

Attempt to make a voxel engine using opengl

## Goals of engine
    - To be able to create and manage windows on linux, windows, macos (maybe)
    - To be able to optimise and create voxels
    - To add realistic -ish physics to the voxels
    - Package in a dll for others to hopefully use
    - To learn more about program design and architecture as well as data structures

## Currently at
    - architecture of the engine
        - Currently making abstract classes for the interface that inherit behaviour from concrete classes through UML diagrams
        - Researching Program architecture

## TODO:
    - refactor of current code
    - (potential) renaming of files and file structure
    - make cmake file more cross-platform
